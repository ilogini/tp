# Simple 3D Game

This repository contains a tiny Three.js game.

* Use the arrow keys to move the blue cube.
* Touch the red cube to score points. It will respawn at a random position.
* Each round lasts 60 seconds and starts when you hit **Restart**.
* After time runs out your score is added to a ranking list that stays until the page is refreshed.

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser to play.
